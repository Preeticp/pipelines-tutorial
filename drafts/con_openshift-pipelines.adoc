= OpenShift Pipelines

OpenShift Pipelines are cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery solutions based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton Pipelines to automate deployments across multiple platforms. Tekton introduces a number of standard Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for defining pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions.

*Key Features:*

* Designed for microservices and decentralized teams
* Standard CI/CD pipelines definition that is easy to extend and integrate with existing tools, enabling you to scale on-demand
* Build images with Kubernetes tools such as Source-to-Image (S2I), Buildah, Buildpacks and Kaniko
* Deploy applications to multiple platforms such as Kubernetes, Serverless, and Virtual Machines (VMs) and are portable across any Kubernetes platform
