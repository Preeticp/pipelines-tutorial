= Triggering and running a pipeline

`PipelineRuns` are used to manually trigger a `Pipeline` and tie it to the Git and image resources that should be used for the specific invocation.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Copy the contents of the following sample `PipelineRun` YAML file and save it.
+
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: petclinic-deploy-pipelinerun-
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: deploy-pipeline
  trigger:
    type: manual
  serviceAccount: 'pipeline'
  resources:
  - name: app-git
    resourceRef:
      name: petclinic-git
  - name: app-image
    resourceRef:
      name: petclinic-image
----

. Create the `PipelineRun` by using the following command:
+
----
oc create -f petclinic-deploy-pipelinerun-.yaml
----
+
Creating a `PipelineRun` automatically creates and triggers the `TaskRuns` for each `Task` in your `Pipeline`. It instantiates the `Pipeline` and creates a number of pods to execute the tasks that are defined in the `Pipeline`.

. After a few minutes, verify that the `Pipeline` ran successfully by listing all the `PipelineRuns` as follows:
+
----
$ tkn pr ls
NAME                                 STARTED         DURATION    STATUS
petclinic-deploy-pipelinerun-lkq7d   7 minutes ago   3 minutes   Succeeded
