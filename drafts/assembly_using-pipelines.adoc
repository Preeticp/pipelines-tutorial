This tutorial uses the link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic[Spring-PetClinic] sample application to demonstrate `Pipeline` concepts and how to create and run a simple `Pipeline` for building and deploying a containerized application on OpenShift. Any Maven based application can use this `Pipeline`.

For this tutorial, we first deploy the sample application on OpenShift, create `Tasks` to be executed by the `Pipeline` and then create and run the `Pipeline` s.
